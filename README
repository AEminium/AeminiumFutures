Aeminium Futures

This is a wrapper around Ã†minium Runtime Tasks that allows for a programming
style similar to Futures.

Futures have two fields: it, the returned value and task, the object that
should be passed to other futures that access that variable.

Note that no code should be outside futures, even if the return type is void.
